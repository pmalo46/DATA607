### Setting up the database
I had a lot of trouble installing the database software this week, so I tried setting up an instance on Google Cloud platform, and created a table using a SQL script.

### Loading the Data
```{r import, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(RMySQL)
db_user <- 'pmalo46'
db_password <- 'password'
db_name <- 'movies'
db_host <- '34.68.212.181'

movies <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user = db_user, password = db_password, dbname = db_name, host = db_host)

df <- dbGetQuery(movies, 
                          "SELECT * FROM movies;"
                          )
df
```
Unfortunately, It didn't work very well, but I have run out of time.
